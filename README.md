# javacode
If you've come because of FTC and are looking for some java code to work with, this is the right place.  

Examples
1) SampleHeading --- this was the development of the heading calculation we use for competition.  You should be able to run it in your favorite development environment.  A lot of times it will take a trial or two to get it to work just right, but it can be done.

Miscellaneous code snippets and small programs.  
Some exist to be portable among machines I may use, 
Others exist to help our FTC students understand how to prototype ideas in a small scale.

There may be some bits in here that are not java, but are in fact perl, python, or whatever.  

Regardless of the language or whether it's robotics related or not, it's all as open source as the license says.
